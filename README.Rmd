`tronr` is a toolbox to explore the [TRON blockchain](https://tron.network/index?lng=en). This R package allows one to collect data on the blockchain's accounts, transactions, token transfers, and smart contract events. In addition, users can query the current and historical market status of [Tronix (TRX)](https://tron.network/trx?lng=en), the native currency of TRON.

## Installation

At the moment, `tronr` is only available on GitHub and can be installed with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("next-game-solutions/tronr")
```

A [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) version of the package is planned for release in the near future.

## Examples

Detailed examples of the `tronr` usage can be found in the [online documentation](https://next-game-solutions.github.io/tronr/). Illustrated below are just a few common queries:

```{r example, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=10, fig.height=4.5}
library(tronr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Current price of TRX expressed in USD, EUR and BTC (Bitcoin):
get_current_trx_price(vs_currencies = c("usd", "eur", "btc"))


# Querying the TRX market data for a historical period, and plotting the 
# evolution of price:
(min_timestamp <- as.POSIXct("2020-01-01 00:00:00") %>% to_unix_timestamp())
(max_timestamp = as.POSIXct("2020-05-01 00:00:00") %>% to_unix_timestamp())

price_history <- get_trx_market_data_for_time_range(
  vs_currency = "usd",
  min_timestamp = min_timestamp,
  max_timestamp = max_timestamp
)

glimpse(price_history)

price_history %>% 
  ggplot(aes(timestamp, price)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()


# Information on the latest block on the chain:
get_block_info(latest = TRUE) %>% 
  glimpse()


# Current balance of an account:
get_account_balance("TQjaZ9FD473QBTdUzMLmSyoGB6Yz1CGpux") %>% 
  glimpse()


# TRC-10 asset transfers to / from an account within a time range:
get_trc10_transfers(
  related_address = "TMaBqmMRekKZMQEq3u3QrJpGDwPYZZo87V",
  min_timestamp = "1577837400000",
  max_timestamp = "1577837430000"
) %>% glimpse()
```

## Things to keep in mind when using `tronr`

The design of this package is rather opinionated, which among other aspects means the following:

1. Under the hood, most of the transaction-related data are queried in `tronr` via a public API that powers the [Tronscan website](https://tronscan.org/). This has a few important implications:
    - The [Tronscan API](https://github.com/tronscan/tronscan-frontend/blob/master/document/api.md "Tronscan API") is considerably slower than the [TronGrid API](https://www.trongrid.io/), which is the recommended tool for use cases that require a computationally efficient and robust mechanism to extract large amounts of data from the TRON blockchain. However, the Tronscan API was chosen due to the richer and more schema-consistent data it returns. As the TronGrid API matures, our decision to use the Tronscan API in `tronr` may change in the future.
    - Attempts to perform frequent and/or "heavy" queries from the same IP address using `tronr` may be treated by the Tronscan servers as [denial-of-service attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service/) and lead to black-listing of that IP address. Users of `tronr` are thus kindly asked to be considerate and implement the respective safeguards in their code (e.g., breaking the queries into smaller chunks, with pauses in between).
    - As a result of the previous two points, `tronr` is _not_ intended for development of high-load analytical application.
2. Many of the `tronr` functions return data in the form of [nested tibbles](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/nest.html) (see examples above). Arguably, this is a natural choice for such data, given their hierarchical structure. Nested tibbles were chosen also because they represent a "tidy" data format compatible with the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/ "tidyverse") toolkit (in particular, the [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/ "tidyr") package). Admittedly, though, not all R users prefer working with the `tidyverse` tools and this makes `tronr` somewhat less accessible and attractive for such users.
