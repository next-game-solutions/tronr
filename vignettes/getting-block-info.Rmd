There are two main functions in the `tronr` package to make block-specific queries. The first one, `get_block_info()`, provides a set of attributes either for the latest generated block or for a specific block referred to by its number:

```{r get-block-info}
# Get data for the latest block (argument `latest = TRUE`):
