\usage{
get_assets_by_name(
  asset_name = "Tronix",
  order_by = "total_supply",
  direction = "desc",
  only_confirmed = NULL,
  max_attempts = 3L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{asset_name}{(character): common name of the TRC-10
asset of interest (e.g., \code{Tronix}).}

\item{order_by}{(character): specifies the variable to
order by (see details).}

\item{direction}{(character): specifies the direction of
ordering the results - descending (\code{desc}) or ascending (\code{asc}).}

\item{only_confirmed}{(boolean or \code{NULL}): if \code{NULL}
(default) or \code{FALSE}, results are returned for both confirmed and
unconfirmed transactions. If \code{TRUE}, only results for confirmed
transactions are returned.}

\item{max_attempts}{(integer, positive): specifies the
maximum number of additional attempts to call the URL if the
first attempt fails (i.e. its call status is different from
\code{200}). Additional attempts are implemented with an exponential
backoff. Defaults to \code{3}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{request_time} (POSIXct): date and time when the API request was made;
\item \code{asset_id} (character): asset \code{id}, presented as a set of numbers
(e.g. \code{1002762});
\item \code{owner_address} (character): address of the asset issuer, in \code{base58check}
format;
\item \code{abbr} (character): abbreviated name of the asset;
\item \code{asset_name} (character): full name of the asset
\item \code{precision} (integer): precision used to present the asset's balance
(e.g., if it is 6, then one needs to divide the returned balance by 1
million to obtain the actual balance for that asset).
\item \code{description} (character): a free-text field describing the asset;
\item \code{url} (character): URL of the asset's project;
\item \code{total_supply} (character): total issued amount of tokens;
\item \code{num} (character): amount of the asset tokens that one can buy
with \code{trx_num} TRX tokens (see next point);
\item \code{trx_num} (character): amount of TRX tokens that is required to buy \code{num}
tokens of the asset (thus, \code{num / num_trx} is the asset's price during
its ICO);
\item \code{ico_start_time} (POSIXct, UTC timezone): date and time of the asset's ICO
start;
\item \code{ico_end_time} (POSIXct, UTC timezone): date and time of the asset's ICO
end.
\item \code{vote_score} (integer): vote score.
}

If no assets are found with the requested \code{name}, nothing (\code{NULL}) is
returned, with a console message \code{"No data found"}.

\description{
Returns a list of TRC-10 assets based on their name
}
\details{
TRC-10 are tokens issued by the system contract (as opposed to
TRC-20, which are issued by smart contracts). See
\href{https://developers.tron.network/docs/trc10}{official documentation}
for details.

TRC-10 assets on the TRON chain are \emph{not} required to have unique names. As
a result, the number of rows in the tibble returned by this function
can be >1.
