api_request(url, max_attempts = 3L)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{(character): URL to call.}

\item{max_attempts}{(integer, positive): specifies the
maximum number of additional attempts to call a URL if the
first attempt fails (i.e. its call status is different from
\code{200}). Additional attempts are implemented with an exponential
backoff. Defaults to \code{3}.}
}
\value{
A named list, the structure of which will vary depending on the
actual \code{GET} request made.
}
\description{
Performs \code{GET} requests, with an exponential backoff mechanism built in
}
\details{
This function only performs \code{GET} requests. The \code{url} is
expected to be built properly before passing onto this function.
The returned data are expected to be in JSON format. This function
will automatically parse the response object and return a named R list
with the respective elements.
